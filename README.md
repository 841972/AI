# README - AI Model Training Notebooks

## Overview
This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks focused on training different types of machine learning models, including Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches. Each notebook provides hands-on exercises and implementations for key AI concepts.

## Notebooks Included

### 1. **Deep Learning with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**
**Filename:** `Deep_Learning_MLP.ipynb`

**Summary:**  
This notebook covers the implementation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for supervised learning tasks. It explores data preprocessing, model architecture, activation functions, optimization techniques, and performance evaluation. Ideal for understanding fully connected neural networks.

### 2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Image Recognition**
**Filename:** `CNN_Image_Recognition.ipynb`

**Summary:**  
This notebook provides an in-depth exploration of CNNs for image classification tasks. It includes convolutional layers, pooling, and dropout for regularization. A step-by-step guide for training and evaluating CNN models on datasets.

### 3. **Bayesian and Normalized Models in AI**
**Filename:** `Bayesian_vs_Normalized_Models.ipynb`

**Summary:**  
This notebook investigates Bayesian and non-Bayesian models, focusing on normalization techniques to improve performance. It covers probabilistic reasoning, data distribution analysis, and model comparisons.
